What a tour this has been!!!
Started on the 27th of Nov with the ODI series.
Woke up early only to see Indian bowlers getting smashed by Smith and Co. though they managed to fight hard with the bat and eventually found a solitary win in the 3rd ODI.

Next came the T20 series. This time it was role reversal with us winning 2-1.

Last was the BG series.
1st test- We were well ahead at stumps on day 2. But never even in my wildest of dreams I have dreamt to wake up and check the score to find India being 36 all out(36/9 actually). Eventually lost the test match only due to that "30 minutes of bad play ".

Captain Kohli departed ,bowlers started getting injured and all hopes were vanishing. But still kept hope on Rahane and Co. and woke up every morning only in hope of a turnaround. And guess what, it did happen.
Yes,it did happen and it happened at Australia's fortress Gabba in front of those spectators who racially abused Indian players both in SCG and Gabba.
That scene of Rishabh Pant driving the ball for 4 and the roar and jump from Shardul,Siraj and Nattu will remain etched in my memory for ages.

Feels no less than a WC win!
