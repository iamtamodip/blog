Engalnd may have lost the urn and may even lose this match and the next one. But the fight and determination that was on display today at the SCG was simply incredible.
At 36/4, with Root gone- it looked like the Brits were gonna rolled out below 100 for a second time in a row.
But then two of their best white ball players join hands and put on their fearless game to disrupt the Aussies in their plans and maybe they followed the template which the Indians showed last year.
Stokes and Bairstow put on an imcredible display of aggressive batting and fought fire with fire. Stokes had his share of luck but continued and Jonny kept on attacking Lyon and the pacers.
And then not to forget the cameo which Wood played in helping to avoid the follow-on. That 100 from JB in itself is a big win for England and they would like to draw a lot of confidence from that stupendous knock, irrespective of the result of these last 2 games.
