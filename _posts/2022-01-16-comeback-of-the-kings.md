And finally, the Yellow army made their comeback in 2018 after serving a ban of 2 years.
They tried bringing back their core of players as has been their trend over the years. Retaining MS and Raina was a no-brainer as Thala and Chinna Thala had been the fulcrum of that franchise and Jadeja was named as the 3rd one. They tried getting back the local boy, R Ashwin but missed out owing to a bidding war with the Punjab Kings(then called Kings XI Punjab) and ended up bringing two more of their family back as they used up their RTM on DJ Bravo, who had been the talismanic all rounder over the years and the evergreen Faf du Plessis, who just keeps getting better and fitter with age.

They bought the explosive Shane Watson as their main opener and then added Ambati Rayudu who has been a maverick player for the Mumbai Indians for the past decade. Another notable purchase was Harbhajan Singh who was undoubtedly one of if not the best Indian spinners in the league.

Fast forward to the league, everyone considered CSK to be a Daddy’s army as the average age of the team was on the higher side of the 30s. With Dhoni’s batting dwindling over the years and quite a few senior members in the squad who had their own fitness concerns, qualifying for the playoffs was definitely not going to be a walk in the park for this franchise.

And to make their job tougher, the 1st game for them was against the most successful franchise in the league and against whom they had unfinished business having lost the final in their previous year in the IPL(2015). Yes you guessed it right. It’s the Mumbai Indians. CSK were set a middling target of 166 but collapsed to 84/6, courtesy Mayank Markande’s leg spin and Hardik Pandya’s medium pace. It turned worse when they became 119/8 in 17 overs, needing 47 off the last 3 overs with DJ Bravo being the last hope who had only Tahir as his partner and an injured Kedar Jadhav to come at no. 11. And they knew those 3 overs were gonna bowled by 3 experienced guys in McClenaghan, Bumrah and Mustafizur.

But DJ Bravo being the player he had been over the years, making things happen was not gonna leave without a fight. He started by smashing McClenaghan for 20 runs with in that Calypso fashion with his trademark over extra cover hits. And then he carted Bumrah all around the park, hitting him for 3 6s and the Yellow Brigade rose on its feet to applause one of the best ever knocks from their players. On that very 1st night, he proved that retaining him was just an emotional attachment but he still has his value in the market.

But then just at the brink of victory, he got out in the last ball of the penultimate over and then it was upto the injured Jadhav to take his team home with 7 required off 6 balls. He played 3 dots in a row, but then scooped the Fizz for a 6 over fine leg, followed by a boundary through the cover region. And…………………………………………………………..

CSK were back…….and they were back to restamp their authority. The MSD-led franchise is back to its winning ways and thanks to one of their very own DJ.

Yes they had quite a few other moments in the league. That herculean finish from MSD against RCB in Chinnaswamy, that insane 100 by Rayudu against the bowling attack of SRH, that knock from Faf which single handedly drove the Daddy’s army to the finals amidst a collapse and not to forget the 100 by Watson in the final where he literally bullied the SRH attack – but the comeback was made in the 1st match itself and it rightly ended with a 3rd title for the Yellow Army, who then became joint most winners with MI.

This would remain as one of the best ever seasons for the Yellove fans and would remain etched in their memories forever.
