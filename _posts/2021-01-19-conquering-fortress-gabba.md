A perfect end to one of the most thrilling test series ever!!!
India breach Australia's fortress Gabba to win the BG trophy 2-1.
But the story is not so simple.
It started from India getting all out for 36 and then losing players every match due to injury.
Then Captain Rahane leads the renaissance of this team with so many young boys and hit that brilliant 100 at MCG.
Then every match new heroes emerged.
Be it Vihari and Ashwin in SCG or Pant and Gill today or Siraj with his fifer or that epic Sundar Thakur partnership.
And last but not the least is Cheteshwar Pujara-
Maybe he didn't score a single 100 or maybe his batting style is not pleasing to the eyes of this T20 generation. But man hats off to his patience and dedication in holding up one end and allowing youngsters to play their natural game. Even today, he kept on taking blows from the deadly duo of Cummins and Hazelwood but stayed on and on and on.
Thanks team India for gifting us with such a dream moment to cherish. ❤❤❤
