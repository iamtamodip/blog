2019 English summer and Ben Stokes- it was a better love story than twilight and he turned into sort of an omnipotent force every time his team had the backs against the wall. He simply enjoyed the best time ever in his life and it all started with the mega event- the ICC Cricket World Cup in England and Wales in 2019.

World Cup 2019

Ben Stokes had a fantastic WC in 2019. He started with an all-round performance against the Proteas in their tournament opener at the Oval. He backed it up with important knocks against SL and Australia, albeit in a losing cause and then a match defying knock against India in a must win game to get themselves back on track at the moment when qualification chances looked to be in jeopardy for England. But these were just bits of the trailer of what was about to come!!!

It all started with the gloomy day at the Lord’s on 14th July 2019. England were just one game away from reaping rewards for all their hard work towards the betterment of their white ball game since that 2015 World Cup Down Under. In fact, they were playing their 1st 50 over WC final since 1992 when Wasim Akram ripped apart through that English lineup in Melbourne.
England were set a target of 242 to make history and lift the 50 over WC for the 1st time ever, that too at the Home of Cricket in front of a passionate home crowd.

But with the slow nature of the pitch and the Kiwi attack which defended a similar total 3 days back against a well-confident Indian lineup- these were definitely gonna make the road much tougher for Morgan’s men.

And it was just the 1st ball of the innings and boom….. Boult bowled a beauty- a brilliant inswinger, pitched on length shaping back in to get Roy trapped and it was only the on-field umpire’s not out decision that saved Roy, who found it to be umpire’s call via DRS.
After a few boundaries here and there, Matt Henry struck, making Roy edge behind to Latham. At this point, Kane Williamson played a masterstroke in bowling out de Grandhomme for 10 consecutive overs, wherein he conceded a mere 25 runs and scalped the priced wicket of Joe Root. To add to England’s misery, Ferguson and Neesham dismissed Bairstow and Morgan in quick succession and England found themselves in a tricky situation at 86/4 at almost the halfway mark, when Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes joined hands.

Buttler played a game changing innings of 59 off 60 on a pitch where almost everyone else struggled to get going and got England back into the game. But Stokes was doing the harder job of grinding in and ensuring that he stays on till the end and see of the chase. And once Buttler was dismissed, it became even tougher.

And then, he had his heart in his mouth for a moment when he slog swept a length delivery from Neesham towards wide long on and Trent Boult patrolling those high traffic areas, kept his calm to almost grab a fantastic catch and seal England’s chances of winning the match (22 were required off 9 balls before that delivery). But, ……… he just stepped on the boundary line with the ball in his hand and Stokes had a stroke of his fortune.

It all came down to the last over. The whole of Lord’s was tensed as Ian Smith was shouting out his voice in the commentary box and Ben Stokes- he knew he had a chance to be a hero after what happened in Bristol 2017.

First two balls, he tried to hit over cover but just failed to do so and it came down to 15 of 4. The game was just slipping out of England’s hands. Next ball, Trent Boult bowls a length delivery and Stokes just plays an astonishing slog sweep against a premium fast bowler for a six over deep mid-wicket.

Now it’s 9 off 3!!! If it has to be someone, it has to be BA Stokes!!! Boult bowls a full toss and Stokes hits it towards deep mid-wicket and the fielder throws it towards the keeper’s end. And as Stokes puts in a full-length dive, the ball gets deflected on striking his bat and runs away for a boundary. It was a 6!!!(Actually, it should have been a 5, but in the heat of the moment, the umpires missed out on checking the point of time when the batsmen crossed).

Stokes just put up his hands in apology and disbelief. But he has been part of something special. Something you don’t get to see often. Can he help his team after this final share of luck?

The next two balls, Stokes managed to pick up singles as his partners got runout at the non-striker’s end both times. (Stokes would have been out had the fielder thrown the ball at the keeper’s end in the penultimate delivery.) Ya, he hasn’t been able to see off his team, but he has made sure they don’t lose. And now he was again gonna bat in the Super Over.

Stokes was already tired and on his haunches for quite a few times. But such is the dedication of this man, that he was not gonna give up. He got another 8 runs off 3 balls in the Super Over, batting with another hero of that day, Jos Buttler and England went on to post 15. NZ were gonna win the WC only if they could score 16 as a draw would have meant an England victory with boundary count being the then ICC rule of deciding the victorious team in case of a Super Over tie.

Jofra Archer went on to bowl the Super Over and it came down to 2 off 1. Guptill whipped it towards deep square and Roy keeping his nerves calm, throws it down to Buttler at the keeper’s end who dived across to light up the stumps and the faces of thousands of English fans. Yes, they have won the ODI WC for the first time ever and their transition in white ball cricket has reaped rewards. Yes, there was a wrong decision, a dropped catch, Buttler’s knock, Archer’s Super Over – but deep down this final belonged to Ben Stokes and he was the center of all attraction. He had come a long way since being hit for 4 sixes in the final over of that T20 WC final in Kolkata back in 2016.
A knock for the ages!!! A man with incredible dedication and determination fighting against all odds and helping his team with all his might!!!

But this was not going to be the end of Stokes’ golden summer. The Ashes was already knocking at the door and little did he know that he was gonna find himself in a similar situation in a month’s time.

The Ashes 2019

The Ashes – one of the oldest rivalries between two extremely competitive cricketing nations took centerstage at Edgbaston, which England almost made a fortress. Steve Smith, who was making a comeback to test cricket after serving a one year ban since the sandpaper saga which took place at Newlands in March 2018 played incredibly well, hitting twin hundreds amidst severe booing from a belligerent English crowd.

The 2nd match was played at Lord’s – the venue where Stokes played one of his finest ever white ball knocks 1 month back. This test match would be remembered for the tooth and nail fight between the express pace of Jofra Archer and the grit and determination of the genius, Steve Smith. And then the introduction of Marnus Labuschagne as a concussion substitute in the 2nd innings, who started his new journey as a middle order batsman and went on to become the No.1 Test batsman 2 years later. But amidst all this, Stokes smashed a brilliant 115\*(165) in the 2nd innings, although Australia managed to draw the game.

Australia were 1-0 up in the series with 3 games to go and the action shifted to Headingley, the ground where Ian Botham and Bob Willis scripted a brilliant turnaround in the 1981 Ashes to win that match by 18 runs and then go on to win the series. 38 years later, another brilliant all rounder playing for the same country was about to script something special.

England won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies. Jofra Archer bowled a brilliant spell and picked up a six-for in only his 2nd test. And despite Warner and Labuschagne registering individual fifties, the Aussies were all out at 179.

Day 2 started with England coming out to bat. Josh Hazlewood bowled superb lines and lengths and picked up 5 for just 30 runs. The Aussies eventually bowled out England for just 67 runs. This was a shame!!!

Being already 1-0 down after 2 tests, this was simply an unacceptable performance. Australia had a comparably better 2nd innings and wen on to score 246. Stokes picked up 3 and England were set a daunting target of 359 to win in the 4th innings. It looked like an improbable task against the Aussie attack comprising of Cummins, Hazlewood, Pattinson and Lyon.

Root and Denly stabilized the innings after 2 quick wickets at the top. But once those departed, the drama started to unfold. Bairstow departed for 36 and then Buttler got run out, owing to a serious misunderstanding between him and Stokes. Soon Woakes was scalped by Hazlewood and Jofra Archer perished in his quest to bag a few quick runs. And then Broad was pinned on the crease by James Pattinson which meant England now needed 73 runs from the last wicket to level the series. The Aussies had their tail up and Jack Leach walked out as the last man to assist Stokes. Till then Stokes had shown appreciable patience, grit and composure. But he knew now he had to change gears.

And it started!!! He started hitting shots all over the park. He slogged Nathan Lyon straight over his head and then even had him switched hit for six. This was a man who was high on confidence. He was not even afraid of taking over the tall fielders. Also, he was pretty sensible and intelligent in rotating the strike at the right points and was ably supported by Jack Leach who had some mannerisms on display, wiping his glasses and delaying things a bit amidst all the tension that was brewing.

It was not over! Now Stokes walked across his stumps to ramp Cummins over the keeper’s head and this was sheer audacity from a man who was at the peak of his powers. Next over, he reached his 100 but was not ready to acknowledge the standing ovation form the Headingley crowd. He knew he had a bigger job at hand. Next two balls, he smashed Hazlewood for two massive sixes. And the carnage went on! He had a bit of luck when he was dropped by Harris off a thick edge but this was an unbelievable innings. It all came down to 2 required now.

Lyon to Stokes-Stokes reverse swept straight to point and was in no mood to go for a single but his partner Leach charged down halfway to steal a single. This was it!!! Stokes’ hard work was gonna go in vain!!! Gonna lose by 1 run………!!! But no …… Lyon fumbles in collecting the throw and Leach gets saved. That was drama at its best.
Next ball, Lyon bowls a fuller delivery to which Stokes sweeps and gets hit on his thighs on missing the sweep. That surely looked plumb in real time but umpire Joel Wilson didn’t raise his finger. And Australia wasted their review against Leach a n over earlier which was in no way gonna be an LBW. They surely had to pay for not using the technology optimally. So, Stokes was saved twice in two balls and maybe this was a gift from the Almighty for playing so well. As the saying goes - “Fortune favours the brave”.

Leach took the all-important single the next over before Stokes smashed Cummins through cover for a four and lets out a roar. Yes, he’s done it!!! He’s done it once again after the WC final!!!

"Cut away. Cut away for four. What an innings. What a player. Take a bow, Ben Stokes. The Ashes are well and truly alive because of one cricketer." -That was one supernatural knock.

And the knock was­­­­­ a tribute to the legendary English all rounder Sir Ian Botham who played that brilliant knock in 1981 Ashes at this same venue to help England win.

England went on to draw the series which meant Australia would retain the Ashes. But this knock from Ben Stokes was surely gonna go down as one of the best knocks ever in the history of Test Cricket.
