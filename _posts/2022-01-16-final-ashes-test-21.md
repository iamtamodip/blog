And the end to a disappointing Ashes for the Brits and an equally wonderful one for the Oz as they retain the urn one more time.
Eng were superb in the 1st one hour of day 1, with Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson using the pink ball to great effect to get Aus stranded at 12/3. But then it was the counterattack from Marnus, Green and Head- who backed up his Gabba heroics with another brilliant 100 under even more demanding circumstances.
England batting once again collapsed in the 1st innings. But then it was a bullet show from Mark Wood who kept on firing thunderbolts and picked up a career best figure of 6/37 to give England a realistic chance of ending the tour on a high, having to chase down only 271.
The dream was about to get real for the Brits as they found themselves at 68/0 just a few minutes before tea, courtesy some crackling shots from Crawley and Burns. But then Green struck to get Burns right at the stroke of tea. And post tea, it was once again a recap of the other matches. Wickets kept tumbling, Stokes just gifted his wicket, Root got out to a peach of a delivery and Eng got all out for 124.
From 68/0 to 124- Sums up England test team....
A lot to do for the management and the players but that's absolute ecstasy for Australia right at the moment.
